# Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a portfolio website built with Rust on both the front end and back end. 

The front end is built using Yew, a robust Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly. It utilizes a component-based architecture, offering a reactive and modular user interface. The back end, on the other hand, utilizes Axum, a Rust web framework built for highly concurrent and asynchronous web services and API layers. It is used in conjunction with SeaORM to programmatically generate SQL queries to a connected Postgres database. The front end, back end and database are deployed with Docker & Docker Compose. This project showcases modern web development practices using Rust by leveraging the power of the language's strong type system, facilitating a high-performance, robust and secure web application.
