# Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a portfolio website built with Rust on both the frontend and backend. 

The frontend is built using Yew, a robust Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly. It encourages a component-based architecture, offering a reactive and modular user interface. The backend, on the other hand, utilizes Axum, a Rust web framework built for highly concurrent and asynchronous web applications. Axum leverages the power of async programming and Rust's strong type system to provide a robust and speedy backend solution. 

This project showcases modern web development practices using Rust, facilitating a high-performance and secure web application.
